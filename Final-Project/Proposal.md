# CS-375
Final Project
Authored: Adham Said

This project will consist of a "Breakout" style game with an emphasis on reinforcing the principles learned during the course of the class. The game will consist of the player operating a bar at the bottom of the screen that will move along the X-axis as a ball will head toward the bottom of the Y-axis on the screen. If the ball makes contact with the plater's bar, then the ball will move back up along the Y-axis and make contact with the destructable bars above. Special textures/colors will be used to make the destructable bars look interesting.

Development Timeline:

-   Week 1 - Implement design of game, and program the objects that the player will see
-   Week 2 - design blocks with a rainbow colorscheme or textures
-   Week 3 - design objects, have variation in ball movement + speed
-   Week 4 - final polish, presentation prep


Possible additions: score system, variation in speed depending on levels reached, powerups

Controls: WASD or arrow-key movements
