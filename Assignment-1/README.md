# Assignment 1

I enjoyed viewing the website [Experiments with Google/WebGL](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL). What I found to be particularly interesting
was seeing the implementation of WebGL by the users of the website. From rendering cars, to creating mazes, and even a mockup of the popular videogame Minecraft;
there was plenty of projects to be seen. While some were outdated given that the projects were implemented over a decade ago, some were still usable and I was
able to run them in my native web browser even after all of these years!
